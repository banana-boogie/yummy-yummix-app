## Project Overview

**YummyYummix** is a cross-platform cooking app with recipe discovery, step-by-step cooking guides, and AI-powered sous chef features. **The app is designed with Thermomix users as the primary audience**, providing specialized cooking parameters and equipment-specific recipe adaptations.

### Target Audience

- Busy home cooks balancing multiple responsibilities (family, work, health)
- Health-conscious and interested in nutrition and dietary wellness
- Looking for time-saving solutions (30-min meals, make-ahead, batch cooking)
- Family-oriented (cooking for households, kid-friendly options)
- Value practical, easy-to-read interfaces over overly playful designs
- Appreciate inspirational content that feels achievable, not exclusionary
- Want warmth and approachability without sacrificing sophistication

### Repository Structure
