## Project Overview

**YummyYummix** is a cross-platform cooking app with recipe discovery, step-by-step cooking guides, and AI-powered sous chef features. **The app is designed with Thermomix users as the primary audience**, providing specialized cooking parameters and equipment-specific recipe adaptations. Our mission: "Make cooking easy and stress-free, with a dash of fun." **Irmixy** is the AI cooking companion that delivers this mission.

### Target Audience
**Primary users are women aged 30-60** who are Thermomix owners. They are:
- Busy home cooks balancing multiple responsibilities (family, work, health)
- Health-conscious and interested in nutrition and dietary wellness
- Looking for time-saving solutions (30-min meals, make-ahead, batch cooking)
- Family-oriented (cooking for households, kid-friendly options)
- Value practical, easy-to-read interfaces over overly playful designs
- Appreciate inspirational content that feels achievable, not exclusionary
- Want warmth and approachability without sacrificing sophistication

**Two key segments:**
- **Sofía (35-45)**: Busy professional, tech-comfortable, wants kitchen efficiency, may have young family
- **Lupita (55+)**: Experienced home cook, has time to explore, **technologically challenged — the majority segment**. Design must guide her explicitly — no self-discovery.

**Mexico-first launch** — Spanish is the primary language.
