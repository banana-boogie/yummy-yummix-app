## Analytics

When adding new features, consider what user engagement signals are worth tracking. See [ANALYTICS.md](./docs/operations/ANALYTICS.md) for:
- Current tracked events and metrics
- How to add new event tracking
- Dashboard queries

**Philosophy**: Track what tells us if users are happy and coming back, not vanity metrics.
