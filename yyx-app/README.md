## 👩‍💻 For Developers

This repository is intended for YummyYummix developers. To get started with development:

1. Request access to the Supabase project
2. Set up your local environment variables
3. Follow the installation steps above
4. Refer to our internal documentation for API endpoints and database schema

## 🧪 Local Development (Recommended Workflow)

### 1) Switch environment
- Local (LAN IP for physical devices):
```bash
cd yyx-app
npm run env:local
```

- Staging (Apple/Magic Link testing):
```bash
cd yyx-app
npm run env:staging
```

> `env:staging` reads from `yyx-app/.env.staging` (you create this file locally).

### 2) Verify local setup
```bash
cd yyx-app
npm run dev:check
```

### 3) Start the app
```bash
cd yyx-app
npm start
```

### 4) Seed + login dev user (local)
```bash
cd yyx-server
npm run seed-test-user
```

Then use the **Developer Login** button on the login screen (dev builds only).
