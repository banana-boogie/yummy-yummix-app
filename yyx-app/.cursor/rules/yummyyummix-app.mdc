# YummyYummix App Development Guidelines

## Description

This cursor rule provides essential guidance for working with the YummyYummix React Native application codebase. It's particularly helpful for:

- Creating new screens or components that need to follow the app's design system
- Implementing responsive layouts that work across mobile and web platforms
- Ensuring consistent styling using the app's predefined constants
- Understanding the proper structure for implementing platform-specific code
- Troubleshooting layout or styling issues related to responsive design
- Maintaining consistency with the app's existing code patterns

**Note**: This cursor rule contains a summary of key guidelines. For a complete, up-to-date reference, 
always refer to the [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md](mdc:yyx-app/yyx-app/docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) document in the codebase.

## Core Principles

The YummyYummix app is a React Native application built with Expo that targets both mobile platforms (iOS/Android) and web,
using Supabase for the backend. Following these key principles is essential:

- **Mobile-First:** Design for mobile first, then adapt for web
- **Consistent Experience:** Provide uniform experience across platforms
- **Responsive Design:** Adapt gracefully to different screen sizes
- **Keep It Simple:** Maintain clean, organized, readable code

## Key Styling Guidelines

1. **Use App Constants**: Always use predefined constants for colors, spacing, typography, etc.
2. **Keep Styles in One Place**: Define all styles in style hooks or StyleSheet objects, never use inline conditional styles in component render methods
3. **Use Responsive Hooks**: Always use the app's responsive system for adaptive layouts
4. **Handle Tab Bar Spacing**: Account for the vertical tab bar on large screens using the proper utilities
5. **Use Cross-Platform Shadow Utilities**: For consistent shadow implementation
6. **Follow Spacing Principles**: Use consistent margin/padding approach
