# YummyYummix App CI Pipeline
#
# Runs on:
# - Push to main/develop branches (when yyx-app files change)
# - Pull requests to main/develop (when yyx-app files change)
#
# Jobs:
# 1. lint-and-typecheck: ESLint and TypeScript checks (typecheck non-blocking until cleanup)
# 2. test: Jest tests with coverage reporting
#
# FOR AI AGENTS:
# - This workflow tests the React Native app (yyx-app)
# - Coverage summary is shown in CI output
# - Coverage report posted as PR comment
# - All jobs must pass for PR to be mergeable
