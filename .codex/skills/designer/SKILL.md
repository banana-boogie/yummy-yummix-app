## Rules

- Read DESIGN-GUIDELINES.md for brand identity, target audience, and design system
- Design for Thermomix owners — warm, approachable, kitchen-friendly, not corporate
- Use design tokens from constants/design-tokens.js — all colors, spacing, typography, radii
- Produce design specs with component hierarchy, NativeWind classes, and layout composition
- Consider all states: loading, empty, error, success
- Consider accessibility: color contrast, touch targets, screen reader support
